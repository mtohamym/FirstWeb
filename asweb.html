        <h1>Egyptian pyramids</h1>
        <h6>11/17/2020</h6>
        <p>The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt. As of November 2008,
            sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identified Egyptian pyramids. Most were built as tombs
            for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.
            The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one
            step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has
            been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the
            period, suggesting there may have been others.The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of
            Djoser built c. 2630â€“2610 BC during the Third Dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex are
            generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.
            The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza
            pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest
            Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence. </p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is the oldest and largest of the
                    three
                    pyramids in the Giza Necropolis bordering what is now El Giza, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven
                    Wonders
                    of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. Its sides climb at an angle of
                    slightly
                    less than 52 degrees, rising to a summit of 480 feet. But how did they manage to manoeuvre 2.5 tonne
                    blocks
                    to such an incredible height without the crane or the block and tackle system? It was a challenge to
                    the
                    ancient Egyptians and still remains a mystery to modern archaeologists.
